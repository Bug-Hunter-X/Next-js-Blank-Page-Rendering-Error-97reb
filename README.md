# Next.js Blank Page/Rendering Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js where an application fails to render correctly, resulting in a blank page or an error message.  The example uses a simple `pages/index.js` file that should render a basic heading.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

**Expected behavior:** The application should render a page with the heading "Welcome to my Next.js app!".

**Actual behavior:** A blank page or an error is displayed.

**Solution:** The solution involves careful examination of the component's export and import statements and checking for any issues with Next.js configuration.  This is demonstrated in the `bugSolution.js` file.
